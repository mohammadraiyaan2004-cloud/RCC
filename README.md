# RCC Design Input Validation Tool (IS 456:2000)

A rule-based web application that assists engineers during the **preliminary RCC design stage** by validating key design inputs against **IS 456:2000 durability and detailing provisions**.

This tool focuses on **input validation and decision support**, not full structural design calculations.

- Nominal cover requirements based on exposure and member type
- Reinforcement diameter warnings for slabs and columns
- Design compliance classification:
  - ✅ Design Compliant
  - ⚠️ Acceptable with Warnings
  - ❌ Not Compliant

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub Pages

---

## 📚 Standard Referenced
- IS 456:2000 — Plain and Reinforced Concrete (Preliminary validation only)

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Steel grade validation
- Automated cover suggestions
- BIM-integrated RCC validation
- Python-based computation engine
